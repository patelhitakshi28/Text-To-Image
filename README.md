#  Text to Image Generation with Large Language Model with HuggingFace

# Motive : 
I created this project which take a written description from a person and turns it into a realistic, artistic image. It's like giving a painter a clear description of your imagination and having the painter draw exactly what you have imagined. Here your painter will be your computer program itself.  

# Description : 
To make my project run efficiently, I set it up to use a GPU, a powerful tool designed to handle repetitive, math-heavy tasks much faster than a regular CPU. This step was crucial because the project relies on advanced technologies, including a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand human-like text and an image generation model from Hugging Face to bring those descriptions to life as stunning visuals. By leveraging the GPUâ€™s speed and efficiency, I ensured the entire process runs smoothly and delivers results quickly.

# Model Used : dreamlike-art/dreamlike-diffusion-1.0 
 - This Model help on creating fine tuned high Quality Art.
 - Text needs to be defined as clear as precise as possible to get the best output. 
 - For eg: I tried few texts in my project :
    1. "A boy holding a teddybear and smiling, dainty figure, long hair straight down, dynamic pose, happy, soft".
    2. "dreamlike, beautiful girl playing the festival of diwali, draped in traditional Indian attire, happy playing around".
